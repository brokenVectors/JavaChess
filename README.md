# JavaChess
I created Chess in Java. Game logic seperated from rendering(uses Swing). 
So far pawns can only promote to Queen, allowing Knight/Bishop/Rook promotion is going to be a PITA.
This was just a project to test my Java skills, probably not at all practical.
Completed more or less in 5 days.
